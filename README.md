# Multicell-systems.
Multicell systems are polygonal networks that are meant to characterize the structure of biological multicellular systems. Multicell systems grow from a single shape (e.g. square) to a lattice of multiple cells of the same shape. This can be done by subdividing an existing shape, or by adding a single shape with the same number of size along the edge of the system. This provides us with analogue to simple biological multicellular systems.

## Growth of a Multicell System.
Rather than growing in cell number through division, multicell systems grow through the recursive partitioning of a space (rectangle or oblinong sphere) using a k-D tree approach. Mapping partition events to a lineage tree, a number of rules can be used to determine that relative size and asymmetry of each partition.

## Limitations.    
One limitation of multicellular systems is that support networks must be formed when each cell in the community have differential access to resources from the outside. These support networks cross the edge between cells, so that this network form a route between all edge in the system. Let us suppose that our multicell systems are in equilibrium when crossings are limited to one per edge -- making two crossings on a random edge for the sake of convenience would perturb flow between compartments of the system. This mimicks gap junctions and other cell-cell communication mechanisms in biological systems. Thsi assumption allows us to adopt the idea of Euler complete paths to characterize these interaction networks.
